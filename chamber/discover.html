        <div class="heading4">The Troutdale City Hall was completed by a citizen volunteer effort in 1922. The original wooden dance floor was the center of social life for years. Later the entire building was remodeled as city hall offices.
          Construction of an aluminum plant to meet wartime needs was a boon to the economy in the mid 1940s and brought workers from all over the nation to work at what is now the industrial park. Eventually emissions from the plant ended the gladiola and other bulb industries and damaged other crops. Completion of Interstate 84 in the 1950s pulled traffic away from the Columbia River Highway and Troutdale. The City remained fairly quiet during the 1950s.
          In the 1960s as Portland suburbs pushed east, Troutdale got its first subdivision, Weedin Addition.  With growth coming, the city was required to build a sewage treatment plant by state agencies. Under the guidance of Mayor Glenn Otto, who later became a state senator and statewide leader, the city boundaries expanded from 320 to more than 2000 acres including the Multnomah County Farm and what was then a home for the disabled and aged.</p>

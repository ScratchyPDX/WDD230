        Troutdale‚Äôs history centers on the confluence of the Sandy and Columbia Rivers where Native Americans, English explorers, Hudson Bay Company fur trappers, and then Lewis and Clark were travelers. The wetlands along the Columbia were hunting and fishing spots for Chinookan Indians once the spring floods eased. In the pools and ponds left behind, native people found fish, bird hunting and camas. Some artifacts were left behind and are in the care of the Troutdale and the Oregon historical societies.

        From the British point of view, the Sandy River was "discovered" in October 1792, by Lt. William Broughton. A rocky lava outcropping, immediately across the Sandy River from Troutdale, was later named Broughton Bluff. The American overland expedition led by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark in 1804-1806, acknowledged Broughton‚Äôs name for the mountain, but renamed what is now the Sandy as the Quicksand on Nov.3, 1805. The earliest settlers to this area came in 1850 and 1851.

        Though smelt runs in the Sandy River are infrequent now, some Troutdale residents continue to hope that eulachon, also called smelt or candlefish,  will once again choose to spawn in the Sandy River. These small oily, silver fish are four to eight inches in length and live two to three days after spawning.
      </div>
      <div class="heading4">  
        In the spring, usually March or April, smelt used to spawn in the Sandy River. Their return was sporadic and part of the fun was guessing when they might return. But when the fish did arrive, entrepreneurs, commercial fishermen, laborers and local businesses all capitalized on them.

      <div class="heading4">
        Smelt are dipped with nets from the bank. The arrival of smelt in the Sandy -- the last big run was in 1980 -- was once the signal for Portlanders to pile in their cars and come to dip or buy smelt. As many as 5,000 people ventured to the river in a single day, forcing Multnomah County Sheriff's deputies to make the Historic Columbia River Highway a one-way road into town, with outbound traffic one-way east on Stark Street.        While individual smelt dippers toted away the limit of 25 pounds of fish for personal use, commercial dippers sold their huge catches to Sea World in San Diego to feed the marine animals.

        The Troutdale City Hall was completed by a citizen volunteer effort in 1922. The original wooden dance floor was the center of social life for years. Later the entire building was remodeled as city hall offices.

        Construction of an aluminum plant to meet wartime needs was a boon to the economy in the mid 1940s and brought workers from all over the nation to work at what is now the industrial park. Eventually emissions from the plant ended the gladiola and other bulb industries and damaged other crops. Completion of Interstate 84 in the 1950s pulled traffic away from the Columbia River Highway and Troutdale. The City remained fairly quiet during the 1950s.

        In the 1960s as Portland suburbs pushed east, Troutdale got its first subdivision, Weedin Addition.  With growth coming, the city was required to build a sewage treatment plant by state agencies. Under the guidance of Mayor Glenn Otto, who later became a state senator and statewide leader, the city boundaries expanded from 320 to more than 2000 acres including the Multnomah County Farm and what was then a home for the disabled and aged.

        Construction began in 1912 as a part of the building of the Columbia River Highway. Troutdale would be the gateway to the remarkable road, which was the engineering marvel of its day and officially dedicated in 1916. While there were earlier bridges across the Sandy River, they were wooden affairs that did not last long and one apparently crumpled in the night, alarming local residents.
      </div>
      <div class="heading4">
        In 1912, while the new bridge was being built, local residents were forced to detour to stark Street to cross the river, or to use a small ferry that crossed the Sandy. The ferry was operating in 1912 during the smelt run when the chauffeur of a large auto misjudged the approach to the ferry, landing in the river and forcing the beautifully-dressed occupants of the car to climb out the top and holler for rescue.

        The Sandy River Delta, more than 1,000 acres on the eastern side of the Sandy River, is now public land and part of the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area.

        The first record of it by English explorers was in 1792 when Lt. William Broughton sailed up the Columbia River on a 'scouting' party for Captain George Vancouver. The British lost the race to claim the Columbia to an American fur trader, Captain Robert Gray, who beat them into the mouth of the river, but they made a go of it anyway. Broughton sailed to the delta naming Mt. Hood after a British admiral and taking possession in the name of the king. Flag Island in the Columbia honors that expedition.

        Lewis and Clark explored the area on November 3, 1805, commenting on the large amount of sand flowing from the Sandy, which they named the Quicksand River. The following spring they were back, camping and hunting in the area for many days and finding seals in the mouth of the Washougal River, on the Washington shore opposite Troutdale.

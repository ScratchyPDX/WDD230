        <p class="text-white text-shadow">Our goal has always been to provide value-added products to local independent markets.
            We deal directly with growers to assist them in marketing their fresh apples, cherries and soft fruit, as well as vegetables, directly to their customers. The fewer steps between the farmer and the end-user, the more profit in your pocket.

      <h1>Bountiful Foods Co.</h1>
      <p>
        It all started back in 1911 when Agostino John Papadopoulos immigrated to Carlsbad from Greece and 
        started delivering produce house to house. His business was passed onto his son Agostino Papadopoulos
        (better known as "Poppy"), thus produce has been a part of Poppy's life since birth. This tradition 
        is one that we are proud of at Bountiful Food Co. remains a family business.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through the years Poppy (and family) has purchased the following companies: Baccelieri Produce, Danna 
        Produce, Rainbow Produce, Wilson Produce, Seitz Produce, and SoCal Meats.
